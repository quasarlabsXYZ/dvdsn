You have a contract that implements a voting system, where only owners can get votes by querying the right array index. The contract also implements a fancy delegate feature.

To pass the challenge, beat the winning checks in the contract.
## Hints
1. is `@view` view only?
2. how is array look like in cairo
3. is the delegate too fancy?
