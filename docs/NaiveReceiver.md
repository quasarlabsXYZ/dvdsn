# Challenge #2 - Naive receiver

Cairo Author: [@notV4l](https://github.com/notV4l)

There’s a tokenized vault with a million DVT tokens deposited. It’s offering flash loans for free, until the grace period ends.

To pass the challenge, make the vault stop offering flash loans.

You start with 10 DVT tokens in balance.
