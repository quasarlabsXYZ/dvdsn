# Challenge #4 - Side Entrance

Cairo Author: [@kootsZhin](https://github.com/kootsZhin)

A surprisingly simple pool allows anyone to deposit ETH, and withdraw it at any point in time.

It has 1000 ETH in balance already, and is offering free flash loans using the deposited ETH to promote their system.

Starting with 1 ETH in balance, pass the challenge by taking all ETH from the pool.
