# Challenge #6 - The Rewarder

Cairo Author: [@0xKarasu](https://github.com/0xKarasu)

There’s a pool offering rewards in tokens every 100 blocks for those who deposit their DVT tokens into it.

Bob has already deposited some DVT tokens, and have won their rewards!

You don’t have any DVT tokens. But in the upcoming round, you must claim most rewards for yourself.

The developer of the project doesn't seem very experienced.

By the way, rumours say a new pool has just launched. Isn’t it offering flash loans of DVT tokens?
