# Challenge #7 - Free Rider

Cairo Author: [@notV4l](https://github.com/notV4l)

A new marketplace of Damn Valuable NFTs has been released! There’s been an initial mint of 5 NFTs, which are available for sale in the marketplace. Each one at 84 DVT.

The developers behind it have been notified the marketplace is vulnerable. All tokens can be taken. Yet they have absolutely no idea how to do it. So they’re offering a bounty of 169 DVT for whoever is willing to take the NFTs out and send them their way.

You’ve agreed to help. Although, you only have 42 DVT in balance. The devs just won’t reply to your messages asking for more.

If only you could get free DVT, at least for an instant.
